## Why Chihaya?

Chihaya is built for developers looking to integrate BitTorrent into a preexisting production environment.
Chihaya's pluggable architecture and middleware framework offers a simple and flexible integration point that abstracts the BitTorrent tracker protocols.
The most common use case for Chihaya is enabling peer-to-peer cloud software deployments.

#### Testing

The following will run all tests and benchmarks.
Removing `-bench` will just run unit tests.

```sh
$ go test -bench $(go list ./...)
```

The Chihaya executable contains a command to end-to-end test a BitTorrent tracker.
See

```sh
$ chihaya --help
``` 

### Configuration
